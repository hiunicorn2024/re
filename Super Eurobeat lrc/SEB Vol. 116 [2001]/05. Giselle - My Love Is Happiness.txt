My love is happiness, like a burning fire
Love is happiness, full of new desire
Love is happiness, sweet communication
Love is happiness, high sensation

Sound of my heart, lovely locomotion
Come to me, baby, don't stop the time
You spin me around, my magic potion
Full of love emotion, take the rhythm
All along, my love is a song
A melody like a magic fever
Hey c'mon, my heart is so strong
We should be dancing forever
My love is happiness, like a burning fire
Love is happiness, like a new desire
Love is happiness, crazy complication
Love is happiness and devotion
My love is happiness, like a burning fire
Love is happiness, full of new desire
Love is happiness, sweet communication
Love is happiness, high sensation

We should be dancing, fly on the ceiling
Come to me, baby, and sing this song
Just take it easy; don't forget it
Moving to the left and to the right now
All along, my love is a song
A melody like a magic fever
Hey c'mon, my heart is so strong
We should be dancing forever
My love is happiness, like a burning fire
Love is happiness, like a new desire
Love is happiness, crazy complication
Love is happiness and devotion
My love is happiness, like a burning fire
Love is happiness, full of new desire
Love is happiness, sweet communication
Love is happiness, high sensation

Sound of my heart, lovely locomotion
Come to me, baby, don't stop the time
You spin me around, my magic potion
Full of love emotion, take the rhythm
All along, my love is a song
A melody like a magic fever
Hey c'mon, my heart is so strong
We should be dancing forever
My love is happiness, like a burning fire
Love is happiness, like a new desire
Love is happiness, crazy complication
Love is happiness and devotion
My love is happiness, like a burning fire
Love is happiness, full of new desire
Love is happiness, sweet communication
Love is happiness, high sensation

My love is happiness, like a burning fire
Love is happiness, full of new desire
Love is happiness, sweet communication
Love is happiness, high sensation
