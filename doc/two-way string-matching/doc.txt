THEOREM (CRITICAL FACTORIZATION THEOREM)
  see the png file

LEMMA 2.1.
  Let l be a critical position of a nonempty word x.
  Let r be a local period at the positionl, such that r <= max(l, |x| - l).
  Then r is a mutiple of p(x)

PROPOSITION 2.2.
  On input words x and t,
  the function "positions" computes the set P(x, t)
  of positions of the pattern x inside the text t.

PROPOSITION 2.3.
  The computation of the set of positions
  of a word x in a text t of length m by the function "POSITIONS"
  uses less than 2m letter comparisons.

COROLLARY 2.4.
  According to the RAM model,
  the maximum time complexity of function "positions"
  is O(m) on an input text of length m.
  The function requires seven extra integer memory locations
  in addition to the arrays x and t

3. The Critical Factorization Theorem
  For each word x, there exists at least one factorization (u, v) of x such that
  r(u, v) = p(x)
  Such a factorization (u, v) is called a critical factorization of x
  e.g. x = abaabaa has three critical factorizations, namely
    (ab, aabaa), (abaa, baa), (abaab, aa)
  (note: same as r(x, l))
